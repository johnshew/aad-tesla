Test demonstrating slow response to AAD Oauth requests when access from the browser in a Telsa

## To see the issue

Go to http://johnshew.github.io/aad-tesla/public/test1.html to see the test in operation.

Note the rapid response (typically a few seconds or less) on most browsers.

Using the browser in the Tesla this same test takes more than a minute to complete.

We would like to determine if this is a bug in the Tesla browser or something AAD is doing that is a problem.
